Description:
  .
  The library is designed roughly on a model/view/controller model.
  Your application is built out of:
  .
  - A functional model type that tracks the state of your application.
  .
  - An incremental /view/ function for computing an HTML-like
  representation of how your application should render on the browser.
  The is based on the [[https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom][virtual-dom]] javascript library.
  .
  - An action type that is used to schedule events that update the
  model.
  .
  Combined with the ability to use Async, and in particular to send out
  network requests using websockets, this should allow the easy
  construction of rich web applications in a fairly comprehensible
  style.
  .
  If you want a more concrete sense of how this works, look in the
  examples directory.
