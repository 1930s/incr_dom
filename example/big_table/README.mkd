This is a example to explore the techniques to implement big tables in incr-dom.

The core ideal is to reduce the resource spent on invisible rows. That includes:

- use [Incr.Map] interfaces for efficient map diffing
- avoid updating big row map too much
- the incremental graph should fire as less as possible
- the dom and html should be as tiny as possible
